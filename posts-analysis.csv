Zehn mutige Kollegen, die sich von niemanden den Mund verbieten lassen wollten. Satiriker, die die Meinungs- und Kunstfreiheit ernst genommen haben und daf\xc3\xbcr mit ihrem Leben bezahlen mussten.

Im ARD-Magazin MONITOR (heute, 21:45 Uhr im Ersten) spricht nun erstmals einer von ihnen \xc3\xb6ffentlich \xc3\xbcber seine Reise nach Syrien und seine R\xc3\xbcckkehr nach Deutschland. Dabei handelt es sich um einen jungen Mann aus Hessen, der im vergangenen Jahr \xc3\xbcber die T\xc3\xbcrkei nach Syrien gereist ist und dort mehrere Wochen in einem IS-Lager verbracht hat. \n \nIn seinen Schilderungen gibt er tiefe Einblicke in das Rekrutierungssystem des IS. Demnach hielten sich ca. 1.000 kampfbereite Dschihadisten in dem Lager im syrisch-t\xc3\xbcrkischen Grenzgebiet auf, von denen die gro\xc3\x9fe Mehrzahl bereit war, als Selbstmordattent\xc3\xa4ter zu sterben. In einer Woche sollen ca. 500 Neuank\xc3\xb6mmlinge im Lager eingetroffen sein, die meisten von ihnen aus arabischen Staaten. Aber auch M\xc3\xa4nner aus Deutschland sollen sich in dem Lager aufgehalten haben. Direkt nach ihrer Ankunft seien ihnen Ausweise und Handys abgenommen worden. Die Reise \xc3\xbcber die Grenze sollen deutsche Dschihadisten mit Hilfe von Schmugglerbanden organisiert haben. Nach Angaben des R\xc3\xbcckkehrers sei das Gebiet regelm\xc3\xa4\xc3\x9fig von Kampfjets \xc3\xbcberflogen worden. \n \nNach mehrw\xc3\xb6chigem Aufenthalt  habe er sich entschlossen, das Lager wieder zu verlassen und nach Deutschland zur\xc3\xbcckzukehren, auch weil er nicht als Selbstmordattent\xc3\xa4ter sterben wollte. \xe2\x80\x9eIch habe gemerkt, dass ich einen gro\xc3\x9fen Fehler gemacht habe\xe2\x80\x9c, sagte er dem ARD-Magazin. \xc3\x9cber die Umst\xc3\xa4nde seiner Flucht wollte er keine detaillierteren Ausk\xc3\xbcnfte geben. Bei der R\xc3\xbcckreise aus der T\xc3\xbcrkei nach Deutschland wurde er von Mitarbeitern des \xe2\x80\x9eViolence Prevention Network\xe2\x80\x9c (VPN) unterst\xc3\xbctzt, einem Verein, der sich in Deutschland um islamistische Straft\xc3\xa4ter k\xc3\xbcmmert. Er habe sich entschlossen, mit seiner Geschichte jetzt an die \xc3\x96ffentlichkeit zu gehen, \xe2\x80\x9edamit andere nicht denselben Fehler machen.\xe2\x80\x9c\n \nMitarbeiter des VPN halten die Bekenntnisse des jungen Mannes im Kern f\xc3\xbcr  glaubw\xc3\xbcrdig. Auch weitere Recherchen des ARD-Magazins haben wesentliche Teile der Schilderungen best\xc3\xa4tigt.\n \nVor dem Hintergrund des von MONITOR recherchierten Falls pl\xc3\xa4diert die Pr\xc3\xa4sidentin des hessischen Landeskriminalamtes, Sabine Thurau, f\xc3\xbcr Deradikalisierungsprogramme f\xc3\xbcr IS-R\xc3\xbcckkehrer: \xe2\x80\x9eIch w\xc3\xbcrde mir w\xc3\xbcnschen, dass bundesweit mehr solcher Kooperationen mit Beratungsstellen entstehen\xe2\x80\x9c, sagte Thurau gegen\xc3\xbcber MONITOR.\n \nZur Zeit besucht der junge Mann, der anonym bleiben will, wieder eine Schule in Hessen und wird von Mitarbeitern des VPN betreut. \n \nDas ausf\xc3\xbchrliche Interview sendet MONITOR heute um 21:45 Uhr im Ersten. \n\n#ard #wdr #ardmonitor #georgrestle #daserste #lka #dschihad #jihad #is #islamismus'",missing_value,missing_value,72.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26.0,20.0,0.0,1.0,2015-02-26 08:00:00,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,201502,0,118.0
